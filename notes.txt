Proposed Solution
Database Structure Modification:

Add a checkedIn field to the Attendee schema (which already appears to exist based on your code)
Add a checkedInBy field to track which concierge performed the check-in
Add a checkedInTime timestamp to record when the check-in occurred

Backend API Enhancements:

Update the check-in endpoint (/events/:eventId/check-in) to set these fields when an attendee is checked in
Ensure the attendee data returned to admins and marketers includes this check-in information
Admin Dashboard Updates:

Modify the admin dashboard to display check-in status for each attendee in the attendees table
Add a filter to view all attendees, checked-in attendees only, or not-checked-in attendees
Add a check-in rate statistic to the event analytics section


Marketer Dashboard Updates:

Add a check-in status column to the attendees table in the marketer dashboard
Update the event performance section to include check-in statistics
Allow marketers to see which of their registered attendees actually attended

Implementation Details
For the Attendee Schema:

The checkedIn boolean field is already present in the code
Would add checkedInBy (reference to User/Concierge) and checkedInTime (Date) fields
For API Endpoints:

Ensure the existing check-in endpoint properly sets these fields
Modify the attendee retrieval endpoints to include check-in information

For Admin Dashboard:

Add a new column in the attendees table showing check-in status with appropriate visual indicators (green for checked-in, red/grey for not checked-in)
Add check-in statistics to event analytics
For Marketer Dashboard:

Similar modifications to the attendees table to show check-in status
Add check-in statistics to their event performance metrics
