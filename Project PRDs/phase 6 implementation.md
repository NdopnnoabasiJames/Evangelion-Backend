## Phase 6: Excel Export Functionality (Duration: 1-2 hours)

### 6.1 Export Service Creation

* **Generic Excel export service** - A reusable service for creating Excel files
* **Template formatting** - Proper styling, headers, and data formatting
* **Column management** - Dynamic column headers based on data type

### 6.2 Export Endpoints

* **States/Branches/Zones export** - Hierarchical geographical data
* **Events export** - Event data with hierarchy information
* **Users/Admins export** - User data with performance metrics
* **Pickup stations export** - Station data with capacity and assignments

I can see there are already placeholder endpoints in the admin-hierarchy controller that return messages like "Excel export for states - To be implemented in Phase 6".

**What we'll build:**

1. **ExcelExportService** - Core service using a library like `xlsx` or `exceljs`
2. **Export DTOs** - Define what data to export and formatting options
3. **Update existing endpoints** - Replace placeholders with actual export functionality
4. **Add new export endpoints** - For pickup stations and other data types

**Key features:**

* ✅ Role-based access control (only admins can export)
* ✅ Jurisdiction-based filtering (admins only see their data)
* ✅ Proper Excel formatting with headers
* ✅ Multiple export formats (States, Events, Users, etc.)

Would you like me to start implementing Phase 6? We'll need to:

1. Install Excel library dependency (`npm install xlsx @types/xlsx`)
2. Create the ExcelExportService
3. Update the existing placeholder endpoints
4. Add new export functionality

Should I proceed with Phase 6 implementation?
