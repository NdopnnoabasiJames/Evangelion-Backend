## Phase 7: Enhanced Authentication & Authorization

### 1. **Enhanced Guards with Jurisdiction Boundary Checking**

* Upgrade existing guards to verify that admins can only access resources within their jurisdiction
* Implement hierarchical boundary validation (e.g., State Admin can't access other states' data)
* Add jurisdiction-aware route protection

### 2. **Dynamic Permission Checking**

* Create a permission system that dynamically checks admin capabilities based on their role and jurisdiction
* Implement fine-grained permissions for different operations (create, read, update, delete, export)
* Add role-based method-level authorization

### 3. **Active Admin Middleware**

* Add middleware to check if an admin account is active/enabled before allowing access
* Implement automatic session termination for disabled admins
* Add graceful handling of disabled admin scenarios

### 4. **Disabled Admin Scenario Handling**

* Create proper error responses when disabled admins attempt to access the system
* Implement logout/session invalidation for disabled accounts
* Add user-friendly error messages for disabled account access attempts

### Key Areas to Focus On:

* **Authentication Guards** : Enhance [JwtAuthGuard](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/hp/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html), `RoleGuard`, and create new jurisdiction-specific guards
* **Middleware** : Create `ActiveAdminMiddleware` to check admin status
* **Exception Handling** : Improve error responses for unauthorized access attempts
* **Session Management** : Handle disabled admin sessions gracefully
